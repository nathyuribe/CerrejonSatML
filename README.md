# CerrejonSatML

Description:

This project uses satellite imagery to analyze the expansion of the Cerrejón coal mine in La Guajira, Colombia, from 1985 to the present day. By examining year-by-year changes in satellite images, we aim to quantify the mine's impact on local communities, vegetation, and water resources.

Objectives:

Track the expansion of the mine: Monitor the year-by-year growth of the Cerrejón mine and its proximity to local communities.
Assess the impact on local communities: Identify areas where communities were forcibly relocated or affected by the mine's expansion.
Monitor vegetation and water resources: Analyze changes in vegetation cover and water quality, particularly in areas where the mine has privatized and contaminated water resources.
Highlight environmental and social concerns: Raise awareness about the environmental and social consequences of the mine's expansion, including deforestation, water pollution, and human rights abuses.
Methodology:

Satellite imagery analysis using Google Earth Engine.
Year-by-year comparison of satellite images to track changes in mine expansion, vegetation, and water resources
Image characterization using Random Forest: We apply Random Forest, a machine learning algorithm, to characterize the satellite images and extract features that describe the mine's expansion, vegetation cover, and water resources. This approach enables us to:
Identify areas of high conservation value and areas affected by the mine's expansion
Quantify changes in land cover and land use patterns
Detect anomalies and trends in vegetation health and water quality
Integration of secondary data sources, such as news articles, reports, and academic studies, to contextualize findings


This is an ongoing project.
