# CerrejonSatML

Description:

This project uses satellite imagery to analyze the expansion of the Cerrejón coal mine in La Guajira, Colombia, from 1985 to the present day. By examining year-by-year changes in satellite images, we aim to quantify the mine's growth and its impact on local communities, vegetation, and water resources.

Objectives:

Document the expansion of the mine: Track the year-by-year growth of the Cerrejón mine and its proximity to local communities.
Assess the impact on local communities: Identify areas where communities were forcibly relocated or affected by the mine's expansion.
Monitor vegetation and water resources: Analyze changes in vegetation cover and water quality, particularly in areas where the mine has privatized and contaminated water resources.
Highlight environmental and social concerns: Raise awareness about the environmental and social consequences of the mine's expansion, including deforestation, water pollution, and human rights abuses.

This is an ongoing project.
